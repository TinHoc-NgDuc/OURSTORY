                <h2>MINIMAL INGREDIENT PHILOSOPHY</h2>
                <p>MERME Berlin is pure and potent clean-skincare. Our minimal ingredient philosophy means that our
                    products are stripped down to their 100% potency, without any hidden fillers, synthetics or
                    chemicals. We use only the most trustworthy and powerful ingredients, mindfully and sustainably
                    sourced from across the globe.</p>
                <p>Our overarching ideology focuses on ‘minimalism in a bottle’ – with our foundational product line
                    consisting of 100% botanical ingredients, and the other with innovative biotechnological
                    ingredients. Our products are so powerful that they can stand alone, untouched, and without any
                    added fragrances or synthetics. With the goal to make skincare easy and effective for everyone,
                    MERME Berlin is a simple, effective range of skin essentials based on best-in-class ingredients. We
                    serve everyone from the Green Beauty Beginner to the All-time Beauty Junkie, who's tried everything
                    and wants to come back to the basics.</p>

                <h2>FOUNDED BY CLAIRE RALSTONY</h2>
                <p>Originally from Australia, Claire‘s passion for clean skincare started when studying at the
                    Australian College of Natural Beauty, where she took particular interest in the effectiveness of
                    non-clinical and natural beauty methods. This, combined with a further ten years in the magazine and
                    beauty industry resulted in one conclusion: Even the so-called “natural” skincare products were full
                    of unnecessary chemicals and toxins.</p>
                <p>After moving to Berlin in 2014, she was unable to find good-for-you organic, skincare ingredients
                    that gave her that sought after healthy glow, so began sourcing them herself – from then, MERME was
                    born. Launched in 2016, MERME Berlin has grown from a singular face oil to over 12 different options
                    for clean skincare that can be combined into an individualised treatment formula. The key product is
                    a cold-pressed Rosehip oil inspired by the beauty routine of Claire's grandmother, whose nickname is
                    also the brands namesake.​ Her minimal-ingredient philosophy was inspired by her late grandmother,
                    who always used homemade, organic oils to cure any skin alignment.</p>

                <h2>WHO IS MERME?</h2>
                <p>“Merme was my grandmother who lived on a cattle farm in northern New South Wales, Australia. Growing
                    up, she believed in the power of nature and living off the land, and had every type of oil for every
                    ailment. She was an extraordinary woman, who was the original power woman to me! Before #girlboss
                    was a hashtag on Instagram. She inspired me to start my own business in a mutual passion of ours –
                    simplified self care.”</p>

                <h2>SCIENCE THAT MATTERS</h2>
                <p>By deeply exploring nature’s tree of life and combining biotechnological advancements, it is possible
                    to create sustainable, high-performance clean ingredients. Whilst remaining vegan, cruelty-free and
                    non-GMO, it is possible to use the benefits of scientific developments to create conscious, clean
                    skincare products. We are not interested in faux-science or silly claims. Just good quality, useful,
                    non-irritating skin care that you’ll like using, and your skin will love.</p>

                <h2>SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
                <p>Sustainability and respecting our beautiful planet is at the forefront of everything we do. We are
                    always seeking to minimise our impact on the environment as much as possible. Whether that be our
                    decision to bottle our products in recyclable glass, use only vegan & cruelty-free ingredients, our
                    elimination of all synthetic ingredients that harm our ecosystem, our use of reusable cotton bags
                    instead of boxed packaging, and our considered shipping practices. Not only should clean skincare be
                    safe for you, but also our planet.</p>
